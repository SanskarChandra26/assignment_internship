The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of the useRef hook in React. You have been provided with a boilerplate code which includes a simple React component wordscounter and a set of failing test cases. The app should function in such a way that when we click on the input box it should get focussed and we also want to set the current value of inputRef to the input element. Your task is to implement the missing functionality so that the app functions in the way as described. Once you have completed the implementation, make sure to verify that the test cases pass.
